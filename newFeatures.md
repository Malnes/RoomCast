- in main setting sunder channels, add toggle button so that i can enable/disable a channel and player. Also, why do i have the option to edit the "Snapcast stream" name? isnt that internal only name? if so then please hide it. Its plenty to just be able to change the "Channel name" wich i assume is just a friendly display name
