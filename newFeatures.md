TODO list
-------

EQs often have a gain fader aswell. Check to see if camilladsp eq (which i assume is the thingy that we are controlling?) have a gain fader. If so, add the gain fader to the EQ. 

- what does the master volume currently control? wouldnt it be better if we moved this volume slider to general settings and renamed it to "Max volume", and then we added another volume slider to the #player-panel which basically controlled the spotify volume slider?

- the files is getting very large, like the index.html is many thousand lines, and you include css and javascript in the same file. Refactor and fix a good file and folder structure fitting for this project. Start with the index.hmlt file
