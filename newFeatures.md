- Let the user create favorite channels in the radio provider. Those favorites should be available to view in the "brose" button (the one that opens radio channels)

- currently, if i add a sonos speaker without actually playing any media, then the speaker is hijacked by this app, meaning im unale to stream to the sonos speaker from any other sources. Make it so that as long as i am not playing any music to the sonos nodes, then i should still be able to use the sonos speakers with other sources. If i hovever press play in roomcast and the music is sending to one of the sonos speakers, then it should take over the session

- in the media payer, if i long press or rigt click the album art, then i should get a menu. For radio, i should get option to add current channel to favorites. If its a spotify song, then i should get option to "add to playlist". clicking that button should then list all my playlists and let me select which playlist to add the song to. As we add providers, this context menu will have different purpouses
