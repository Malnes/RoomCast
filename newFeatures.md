- in the /web-node route, remove the "back to home" button.

- In the /web-node route, show cover art and song artiist/title (metadata) of current stream

- When playing radio, i would like the seek bar to be all the way to the right instead of all the way to the left, and the number to the left of the seek bar, i want to be a total play time. I mean how long the current player has been playing that radio channel

- The volume slider on the node isn applied until i release the slider. It should update realtime

- WHen i node is added, no matter node type, i dont want it to be connected to any channels. So we basically need another alternative in the node list: "Unassigned" or something like that.
