TODO list

- currently i have to start spotify and then send audio to this app. I want to be able to play audio through this app without having to open spotify. Would that be possible? if spotify is playing somewhere else, there should be a button in the middle of the player-panel that says "Take over" or something like that, and then the music starts playing through roomcast isntead

- Add a playlists button. Clicking it should open up a modal showing all the users playlists. Clicking a playlist should show all the songs in that playlist. Clicking a song should play it. Remember to add back buttons. Place the playlist button to the left og the volume button and use this icon:
