TODO list

- When in the EQ, i want to be able to select different skins. This current look can be the default skin, but i want a skin that makes it look more like a normal parametric EQ with "real" faders. were not going to fit all on one screen because of limited width, so we will have to rely on horizontal zoom. Basically just a dead simple marametric eq. It does not need to have frequency selectors, nor q value. Just a fader on a fixed frequency ( ishould be bale to see frequency and gain value), and i should have option to toggle between 15 or 31 band eq. If i flip my phone over in horizontal view, then it should view more faders.

- The settings and eq button in the nodes list, remove the background so that its basically just the icon tself, and make sure the icons is the same size

- Remove the "nodes" panel. Not the content inside the nodes panel, bust the outer shell as it doesnt have a function. Now its just like a box in a box.
