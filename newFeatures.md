- i want to be able to turn the computer running the RoomCast server into a client aswell, this way i can install everything in a raspberry pi and that raspberry py will be the main controller AND one of my clients. Preferably, i should be able to press the "Add node" button at top and have a option to "Add server as node" or something like that. Is this achieveable, or do we have to then have a different docker compose that also includes the snapserver image?
