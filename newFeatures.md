- currently i have to start spotify and then send audio to this app. I want to be able to play audio through this app without having to open spotify. Would that be possible? if spotify is playing somewhere else, there should be a button in the middle of the player-panel that says "Take over" or something like that, and then the music starts playing through roomcast isntead



- Add a search button to search spotify. The search result should contain tabs at the top for album, songs, artists and playlists. Use this icon:

- the app refreshes on interval. Why is it doing like that? wouldnt it be better with a websocket?
