- currently, if i add a sonos speaker without actually playing any media, then the speaker is hijacked by this app, meaning im unale to stream to the sonos speaker from any other sources. Make it so that as long as i am not playing any music to the sonos nodes, then i should still be able to use the sonos speakers with other sources. If i hovever press play in roomcast and the music is sending to one of the sonos speakers, then it should take over the session
