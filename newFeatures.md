- Add web node approval, meaning when i add a web node, and press connect, then theres hould be a popup in the main app where i have to approve or deny the node connetion

- When playing radio, i would like the seek bar to be all the way to the right instead of all the way to the left, and the number to the left of the seek bar, i want to be a total play time. I mean how long the current player has been playing that radio channel

- The volume slider on the node isn applied until i release the slider. It should update realtime
