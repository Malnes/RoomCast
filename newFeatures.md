TODO list
-------

- currently i have to start spotify and then send audio to this app. I want to be able to play audio through this app without having to open spotify. Would that be possible? if spotify is playing somewhere else, there should be a button in the middle of the player-panel that says "Take over" or something like that, and then the music starts playing through roomcast isntead

- the app refreshes on interval. Why is it doing like that? wouldnt it be better with a websocket?

- once i play a song, i want to be able to click in the player art in the player panel to open up current

- remove text: "Choose a track to play"

- Make the player art 50% larger and make it clickable. Clicking it should show the play queue

- Implement a secondary spotify sign in. so, in main settings, basically add another "spotify setup". maybe call them Account 1 and 2. And in the main screen i should be able to specify if a node should get music from channel 1 or channel 2 (spotify account 1 or 2). Basically add a toggle button that toggles between CH1 and CH2. Switching between the two accounts in the player-panel chouls be accomplished by swiping the whole player-panel ro the side. So one large swipe should switch to the next player for the next account. This app must still be usable with only one spotify account
