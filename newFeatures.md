TODO list
-------

- the app refreshes on interval. Why is it doing like that? wouldnt it be better with a websocket?

- Implement a secondary spotify sign in. so, in main settings, basically add another "spotify setup". maybe call them Account 1 and 2. And in the main screen i should be able to specify if a node should get music from channel 1 or channel 2 (spotify account 1 or 2). Basically add a toggle button that toggles between CH1 and CH2. Switching between the two accounts in the player-panel chouls be accomplished by swiping the whole player-panel ro the side. So one large swipe should switch to the next player for the next account. This app must still be usable with only one spotify account

- Turn the app into PWA for mobile phones. 

- If im playing from a playlist, and select the playlist button, it opens th emodal where i can see all songs in that playlist, but i also see that its actually loading all the playlists. This is not nessessary. So instead of loading in the playlists, just load in the songs, and when i press the "all playlists" bustton (the back button), then you can load the playlists.
