- Let the user create favorite channels in the radio provider. Those favorites should be available to view in the "brose" button (the one that opens radio channels)

- currently, if i add a sonos speaker without actually playing any media, then the speaker is hijacked by this app, meaning im unale to stream to the sonos speaker from any other sources. Make it so that as long as i am not playing any music to the sonos nodes, then i should still be able to use the sonos speakers with other sources. If i hovever press play in roomcast and the music is sending to one of the sonos speakers, then it should take over the session

- in the media payer, if i long press or rigt click the album art, then i should get a menu. For radio, i should get option to add current channel to favorites. If its a spotify song, then i should get option to "add to playlist". clicking that button should then list all my playlists and let me select which playlist to add the song to. As we add providers, this context menu will have different purpouses

- the sonos speakers have unique names that i have given when i added them in the sonos app, but this name is not displayed when i search for and connect to a sonos speaker in roomCast. Can we fix this? the main issue with this not working is that its hard to identify which speaker is which. As it is now, i have to play audio to identify the speaker. it would be much easier if it displayed the name that it has been given in the sonos app. Keep in mind that this has nothing to do with the node displayname
