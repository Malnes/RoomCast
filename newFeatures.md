- i want to be able to turn the computer running the RoomCast server into a client aswell, this way i can install everything in a raspberry pi and that raspberry py will be the main controller AND one of my clients. Preferably, i should be able to press the "Add node" button at top and have a option to "Add server as node" or something like that. Is this achieveable, or do we have to then have a different docker compose that also includes the snapserver image?


- In the node list, replace the "Online" and "Offline" with a wifi icon indicating the wifi strength of the node. Here you must get wifi signal from the node and you must switch between wifi icons fo signal the different strengths. Also, if the node is disconnected, the icon should reflect that aswell.
