- in channels in main menu, temove the text "Configure channel names, accent colours, and Snapcast stream mapping. Changes save per channel." and under general remove the text: "Shown across the UI and in Spotify when you take over playback." And finaly, lock the "Use cover art as background" to always be enabled and remove the setting. No need to expose the setting as it should always be enabled

- remove the "Tap play to resume on RoomCast" which is displayed in player-panel when no media is playing

- move takeover-banner to the center of the screen
