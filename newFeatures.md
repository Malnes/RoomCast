- When in the EQ, i want to be able to select different skins. This current look can be the default skin, but i want a skin that makes it look more like a normal parametric EQ with "real" faders. were not going to fit all on one screen because of limited width, so we will have to rely on horizontal zoom. Basically just a dead simple marametric eq. It does not need to have frequency selectors, nor q value. Just a fader on a fixed frequency ( ishould be bale to see frequency and gain value), and i should have option to toggle between 15 or 31 band eq. If i flip my phone over in horizontal view, then it should view more faders.


- replace current "Discover nodes" button with a plus icon top right in the nodes panel
