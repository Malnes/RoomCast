- When in the EQ, i want to be able to select different skins. This current look can be the default skin, but i want a skin that makes it look more like a normal parametric EQ with "real" faders. were not going to fit all on one screen because of limited width, so we will have to rely on horizontal zoom. Basically just a dead simple marametric eq. It does not need to have frequency selectors, nor q value. Just a fader on a fixed frequency ( ishould be bale to see frequency and gain value), and i should have option to toggle between 15 or 31 band eq. If i flip my phone over in horizontal view, then it should view more faders.

- remove the agent version from the nodes in the nodes list if theres no new versions. 

- In top of the screen, theres a refresh button. Is it nessessary? it seems to me that the app is refreshing all the time anyways.

- the sliders cannot be "slid" all the way to the edges. 

- make the player-panel transparent

- in nodes panel, move the eq button up to the left of the settings gear icon on the node

- replace current "Discover nodes" button with a plus icon top right in the nodes panel

- shuffle and repeat buttons dont work:
